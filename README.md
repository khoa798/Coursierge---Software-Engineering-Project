Coursierge aims to tackle an ongoing social and technical challenge of providing education to students who are unable to attend lectures under any circumstances. Many students find themselves unable to attend lectures due to an illness, lack of transport, or more personal reasons. With Coursierge, any student can continue to receive top quality education from their professors from the comforts of any room with the support of VR.
